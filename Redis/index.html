<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># Redis configuration file example.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Note that in order to read the configuration file, Redis must be</span>
<span class="c1"># started with the file path as first argument:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># ./redis-server /path/to/redis.conf</span>

<span class="c1"># Note on units: when memory size is needed, it is possible to specify</span>
<span class="c1"># it in the usual form of 1k 5GB 4M and so forth:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 1k =&gt; 1000 bytes</span>
<span class="c1"># 1kb =&gt; 1024 bytes</span>
<span class="c1"># 1m =&gt; 1000000 bytes</span>
<span class="c1"># 1mb =&gt; 1024*1024 bytes</span>
<span class="c1"># 1g =&gt; 1000000000 bytes</span>
<span class="c1"># 1gb =&gt; 1024*1024*1024 bytes</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># units are case insensitive so 1GB 1Gb 1gB are all the same.</span>

<span class="c1">################################## INCLUDES ###################################</span>

<span class="c1"># Include one or more other config files here.  This is useful if you</span>
<span class="c1"># have a standard template that goes to all Redis servers but also need</span>
<span class="c1"># to customize a few per-server settings.  Include files can include</span>
<span class="c1"># other files, so use this wisely.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Notice option &quot;include&quot; won&#39;t be rewritten by command &quot;CONFIG REWRITE&quot;</span>
<span class="c1"># from admin or Redis Sentinel. Since Redis always uses the last processed</span>
<span class="c1"># line as value of a configuration directive, you&#39;d better put includes</span>
<span class="c1"># at the beginning of this file to avoid overwriting config change at runtime.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># If instead you are interested in using includes to override configuration</span>
<span class="c1"># options, it is better to use include as the last line.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># include /path/to/local.conf</span>
<span class="c1"># include /path/to/other.conf</span>

<span class="c1">################################## MODULES #####################################</span>

<span class="c1"># Load modules at startup. If the server is not able to load modules</span>
<span class="c1"># it will abort. It is possible to use multiple loadmodule directives.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># loadmodule /path/to/my_module.so</span>
<span class="c1"># loadmodule /path/to/other_module.so</span>

<span class="c1">################################## NETWORK #####################################</span>

<span class="c1"># By default, if no &quot;bind&quot; configuration directive is specified, Redis listens</span>
<span class="c1"># for connections from all the network interfaces available on the server.</span>
<span class="c1"># It is possible to listen to just one or multiple selected interfaces using</span>
<span class="c1"># the &quot;bind&quot; configuration directive, followed by one or more IP addresses.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Examples:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1</span>
<span class="c1"># bind 127.0.0.1 ::1</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># ~~~ WARNING ~~~ If the computer running Redis is directly exposed to the</span>
<span class="c1"># internet, binding to all the interfaces is dangerous and will expose the</span>
<span class="c1"># instance to everybody on the internet. So by default we uncomment the</span>
<span class="c1"># following bind directive, that will force Redis to listen only into</span>
<span class="c1"># the IPv4 lookback interface address (this means Redis will be able to</span>
<span class="c1"># accept connections only from clients running into the same computer it</span>
<span class="c1"># is running).</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># IF YOU ARE SURE YOU WANT YOUR INSTANCE TO LISTEN TO ALL THE INTERFACES</span>
<span class="c1"># JUST COMMENT THE FOLLOWING LINE.</span>

<span class="c1">################################# REPLICATION #################################</span>

<span class="c1"># Master-Slave replication. Use slaveof to make a Redis instance a copy of</span>
<span class="c1"># another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 1) Redis replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to</span>
<span class="c1">#    stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least</span>
<span class="c1">#    a given number of slaves.</span>
<span class="c1"># 2) Redis slaves are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the</span>
<span class="c1">#    master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of</span>
<span class="c1">#    time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next</span>
<span class="c1">#    sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.</span>
<span class="c1"># 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a</span>
<span class="c1">#    network partition slaves automatically try to reconnect to masters</span>
<span class="c1">#    and resynchronize with them.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># slaveof &lt;masterip&gt; &lt;masterport&gt;</span>

<span class="c1"># If the master is password protected (using the &quot;requirepass&quot; configuration</span>
<span class="c1"># directive below) it is possible to tell the slave to authenticate before</span>
<span class="c1"># starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will</span>
<span class="c1"># refuse the slave request.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># masterauth &lt;master-password&gt;</span>

<span class="c1"># When a slave loses its connection with the master, or when the replication</span>
<span class="c1"># is still in progress, the slave can act in two different ways:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 1) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to &#39;yes&#39; (the default) the slave will</span>
<span class="c1">#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the</span>
<span class="c1">#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 2) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to &#39;no&#39; the slave will reply with</span>
<span class="c1">#    an error &quot;SYNC with master in progress&quot; to all the kind of commands</span>
<span class="c1">#    but to INFO and SLAVEOF.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="na">slave-serve-stale-data yes</span>

<span class="c1"># You can configure a slave instance to accept writes or not. Writing against</span>
<span class="c1"># a slave instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data</span>
<span class="c1"># written on a slave will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but</span>
<span class="c1"># may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a</span>
<span class="c1"># misconfiguration.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Since Redis 2.6 by default slaves are read-only.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Note: read only slaves are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients</span>
<span class="c1"># on the internet. It&#39;s just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.</span>
<span class="c1"># Still a read only slave exports by default all the administrative commands</span>
<span class="c1"># such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extent you can improve</span>
<span class="c1"># security of read only slaves using &#39;rename-command&#39; to shadow all the</span>
<span class="c1"># administrative / dangerous commands.</span>

<span class="c1"># -------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># New slaves and reconnecting slaves that are not able to continue the replication</span>
<span class="c1"># process just receiving differences, need to do what is called a &quot;full</span>
<span class="c1"># synchronization&quot;. An RDB file is transmitted from the master to the slaves.</span>
<span class="c1"># The transmission can happen in two different ways:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 1) Disk-backed: The Redis master creates a new process that writes the RDB</span>
<span class="c1">#                 file on disk. Later the file is transferred by the parent</span>
<span class="c1">#                 process to the slaves incrementally.</span>
<span class="c1"># 2) Diskless: The Redis master creates a new process that directly writes the</span>
<span class="c1">#              RDB file to slave sockets, without touching the disk at all.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># With disk-backed replication, while the RDB file is generated, more slaves</span>
<span class="c1"># can be queued and served with the RDB file as soon as the current child producing</span>
<span class="c1"># the RDB file finishes its work. With diskless replication instead once</span>
<span class="c1"># the transfer starts, new slaves arriving will be queued and a new transfer</span>
<span class="c1"># will start when the current one terminates.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># When diskless replication is used, the master waits a configurable amount of</span>
<span class="c1"># time (in seconds) before starting the transfer in the hope that multiple slaves</span>
<span class="c1"># will arrive and the transfer can be parallelized.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>

<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># This is important since once the transfer starts, it is not possible to serve</span>
<span class="c1"># new slaves arriving, that will be queued for the next RDB transfer, so the server</span>
<span class="c1"># waits a delay in order to let more slaves arrive.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The delay is specified in seconds, and by default is 5 seconds. To disable</span>

<span class="na">repl-disable-tcp-nodelay no</span>

<span class="c1"># Set the replication backlog size. The backlog is a buffer that accumulates</span>
<span class="c1"># slave data when slaves are disconnected for some time, so that when a slave</span>
<span class="c1"># wants to reconnect again, often a full resync is not needed, but a partial</span>
<span class="c1"># resync is enough, just passing the portion of data the slave missed while</span>
<span class="c1"># disconnected.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The bigger the replication backlog, the longer the time the slave can be</span>

<span class="c1"># the backlog buffer to be freed.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>

<span class="c1"># promoted to masters later, and should be able to correctly &quot;partially</span>

<span class="c1"># master if the master is no longer working correctly.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># A slave with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so</span>
<span class="c1"># for instance if there are three slaves with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel will</span>
<span class="c1"># pick the one with priority 10, that is the lowest.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># However a special priority of 0 marks the slave as not able to perform the</span>
<span class="c1"># role of master, so a slave with priority of 0 will never be selected by</span>
<span class="c1"># Redis Sentinel for promotion.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># By default the priority is 100.</span>
<span class="na">slave-priority 100</span>

<span class="c1"># It is possible for a master to stop accepting writes if there are less than</span>
<span class="c1"># N slaves connected, having a lag less or equal than M seconds.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The N slaves need to be in &quot;online&quot; state.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The lag in seconds, that must be &lt;= the specified value, is calculated from</span>

<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># This option does not GUARANTEE that N replicas will accept the write, but</span>
<span class="c1"># will limit the window of exposure for lost writes in case not enough slaves</span>
<span class="c1"># are available, to the specified number of seconds.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># For example to require at least 3 slaves with a lag &lt;= 10 seconds use:</span>

<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># WARNING: If you have slaves attached to an instance with maxmemory on,</span>
<span class="c1"># the size of the output buffers needed to feed the slaves are subtracted</span>

<span class="c1"># of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># In short... if you have slaves attached it is suggested that you set a lower</span>

<span class="c1">############################# LAZY FREEING ####################################</span>

<span class="c1"># Redis has two primitives to delete keys. One is called DEL and is a blocking</span>
<span class="c1"># deletion of the object. It means that the server stops processing new commands</span>
<span class="c1"># in order to reclaim all the memory associated with an object in a synchronous</span>
<span class="c1"># way. If the key deleted is associated with a small object, the time needed</span>
<span class="c1"># in order to execute th DEL command is very small and comparable to most other</span>
<span class="c1"># O(1) or O(log_N) commands in Redis. However if the key is associated with an</span>
<span class="c1"># aggregated value containing millions of elements, the server can block for</span>
<span class="c1"># a long time (even seconds) in order to complete the operation.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># For the above reasons Redis also offers non blocking deletion primitives</span>
<span class="c1"># such as UNLINK (non blocking DEL) and the ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and</span>
<span class="c1"># FLUSHDB commands, in order to reclaim memory in background. Those commands</span>
<span class="c1"># are executed in constant time. Another thread will incrementally free the</span>
<span class="c1"># object in the background as fast as possible.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># DEL, UNLINK and ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and FLUSHDB are user-controlled.</span>
<span class="c1"># It&#39;s up to the design of the application to understand when it is a good</span>
<span class="c1"># idea to use one or the other. However the Redis server sometimes has to</span>
<span class="c1"># delete keys or flush the whole database as a side effect of other operations.</span>
<span class="c1"># Specifically Redis deletes objects independently of an user call in the</span>
<span class="c1"># following scenarios:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 1) On eviction, because of the maxmemory and maxmemory policy configurations,</span>
<span class="c1">#    in order to make room for new data, without going over the specified</span>
<span class="c1">#    memory limit.</span>
<span class="c1"># 2) Because of expire: when a key with an associated time to live (see the</span>
<span class="c1">#    EXPIRE command) must be deleted from memory.</span>
<span class="c1"># 3) Because of a side effect of a command that stores data on a key that may</span>
<span class="c1">#    already exist. For example the RENAME command may delete the old key</span>
<span class="c1">#    content when it is replaced with another one. Similarly SUNIONSTORE</span>
<span class="c1">#    or SORT with STORE option may delete existing keys. The SET command</span>
<span class="c1">#    itself removes any old content of the specified key in order to replace</span>
<span class="c1">#    it with the specified string.</span>
<span class="c1"># 4) During replication, when a slave performs a full resynchronization with</span>
<span class="c1">#    its master, the content of the whole database is removed in order to</span>
<span class="c1">#    load the RDB file just transfered.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># In all the above cases the default is to delete objects in a blocking way,</span>
<span class="c1"># like if DEL was called. However you can configure each case specifically</span>
<span class="c1"># in order to instead release memory in a non-blocking way like if UNLINK</span>
<span class="c1"># was called, using the following configuration directives:</span>

<span class="na">lazyfree-lazy-eviction no</span>
<span class="na">lazyfree-lazy-expire no</span>
<span class="na">lazyfree-lazy-server-del no</span>
<span class="na">slave-lazy-flush no</span>

<span class="c1">############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################</span>

<span class="c1"># By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is</span>
<span class="c1"># good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or</span>
<span class="c1"># a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on</span>
<span class="c1"># the configured save points).</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides</span>
<span class="c1"># much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy</span>
<span class="c1"># (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a</span>
<span class="c1"># dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something</span>
<span class="c1"># wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is</span>
<span class="c1"># still running correctly.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.</span>
<span class="c1"># If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file</span>
<span class="c1"># with the better durability guarantees.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Please check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.</span>

<span class="na">appendonly no</span>

<span class="c1"># The name of the append only file (default: &quot;appendonly.aof&quot;)</span>

<span class="na">appendfilename &quot;appendonly.aof&quot;</span>

<span class="c1"># The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk</span>
<span class="c1"># instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush</span>
<span class="c1"># data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Redis supports three different modes:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># no: don&#39;t fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.</span>
<span class="c1"># always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.</span>
<span class="c1"># everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The default is &quot;everysec&quot;, as that&#39;s usually the right compromise between</span>
<span class="c1"># speed and data safety. It&#39;s up to you to understand if you can relax this to</span>
<span class="c1"># &quot;no&quot; that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when</span>
<span class="c1"># it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of</span>
<span class="c1"># some data loss consider the default persistence mode that&#39;s snapshotting),</span>
<span class="c1"># or on the contrary, use &quot;always&quot; that&#39;s very slow but a bit safer than</span>
<span class="c1"># everysec.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># More details please check the following article:</span>
<span class="c1"># http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># If unsure, use &quot;everysec&quot;.</span>

<span class="c1"># appendfsync always</span>
<span class="na">appendfsync everysec</span>
<span class="c1"># appendfsync no</span>

<span class="c1"># When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background</span>
<span class="c1"># saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is</span>
<span class="c1"># performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations</span>
<span class="c1"># Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for</span>
<span class="c1"># this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block</span>
<span class="c1"># our synchronous write(2) call.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># In order to mitigate this problem it&#39;s possible to use the following option</span>
<span class="c1"># that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a</span>
<span class="c1"># BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is</span>
<span class="c1"># the same as &quot;appendfsync none&quot;. In practical terms, this means that it is</span>
<span class="c1"># possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the</span>
<span class="c1"># default Linux settings).</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># If you have latency problems turn this to &quot;yes&quot;. Otherwise leave it as</span>
<span class="c1"># &quot;no&quot; that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.</span>

<span class="na">no-appendfsync-on-rewrite no</span>

<span class="c1"># Automatic rewrite of the append only file.</span>
<span class="c1"># Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling</span>
<span class="c1"># BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the</span>
<span class="c1"># latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of</span>
<span class="c1"># the AOF at startup is used).</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is</span>
<span class="c1"># bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also</span>
<span class="c1"># you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this</span>
<span class="c1"># is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase</span>
<span class="c1"># is reached but it is still pretty small.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF</span>
<span class="c1"># rewrite feature.</span>

<span class="na">auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100</span>
<span class="na">auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb</span>

<span class="c1"># An AOF file may be found to be truncated at the end during the Redis</span>
<span class="c1"># startup process, when the AOF data gets loaded back into memory.</span>
<span class="c1"># This may happen when the system where Redis is running</span>
<span class="c1"># crashes, especially when an ext4 filesystem is mounted without the</span>
<span class="c1"># data=ordered option (however this can&#39;t happen when Redis itself</span>
<span class="c1"># crashes or aborts but the operating system still works correctly).</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Redis can either exit with an error when this happens, or load as much</span>
<span class="c1"># data as possible (the default now) and start if the AOF file is found</span>
<span class="c1"># to be truncated at the end. The following option controls this behavior.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># If aof-load-truncated is set to yes, a truncated AOF file is loaded and</span>
<span class="c1"># the Redis server starts emitting a log to inform the user of the event.</span>
<span class="c1"># Otherwise if the option is set to no, the server aborts with an error</span>
<span class="c1"># and refuses to start. When the option is set to no, the user requires</span>
<span class="c1"># to fix the AOF file using the &quot;redis-check-aof&quot; utility before to restart</span>
<span class="c1"># the server.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Note that if the AOF file will be found to be corrupted in the middle</span>
<span class="c1"># the server will still exit with an error. This option only applies when</span>
<span class="c1"># Redis will try to read more data from the AOF file but not enough bytes</span>
<span class="c1"># will be found.</span>
<span class="na">aof-load-truncated yes</span>

<span class="c1"># When rewriting the AOF file, Redis is able to use an RDB preamble in the</span>
<span class="c1"># AOF file for faster rewrites and recoveries. When this option is turned</span>

<span class="c1">#</span>

<span class="c1"># A slave of a failing master will avoid to start a failover if its data</span>
<span class="c1"># looks too old.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># There is no simple way for a slave to actually have an exact measure of</span>
<span class="c1"># its &quot;data age&quot;, so the following two checks are performed:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 1) If there are multiple slaves able to failover, they exchange messages</span>
<span class="c1">#    in order to try to give an advantage to the slave with the best</span>
<span class="c1">#    replication offset (more data from the master processed).</span>
<span class="c1">#    Slaves will try to get their rank by offset, and apply to the start</span>
<span class="c1">#    of the failover a delay proportional to their rank.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 2) Every single slave computes the time of the last interaction with</span>
<span class="c1">#    its master. This can be the last ping or command received (if the master</span>
<span class="c1">#    is still in the &quot;connected&quot; state), or the time that elapsed since the</span>
<span class="c1">#    disconnection with the master (if the replication link is currently down).</span>
<span class="c1">#    If the last interaction is too old, the slave will not try to failover</span>
<span class="c1">#    at all.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The point &quot;2&quot; can be tuned by user. Specifically a slave will not perform</span>
<span class="c1"># the failover if, since the last interaction with the master, the time</span>
<span class="c1"># elapsed is greater than:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#   (node-timeout * slave-validity-factor) + repl-ping-slave-period</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># So for example if node-timeout is 30 seconds, and the slave-validity-factor</span>
<span class="c1"># is 10, and assuming a default repl-ping-slave-period of 10 seconds, the</span>
<span class="c1"># slave will not try to failover if it was not able to talk with the master</span>
<span class="c1"># for longer than 310 seconds.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>

<span class="c1">#</span>

<span class="c1">########################## CLUSTER DOCKER/NAT support  ########################</span>

<span class="c1"># In certain deployments, Redis Cluster nodes address discovery fails, because</span>
<span class="c1"># addresses are NAT-ted or because ports are forwarded (the typical case is</span>
<span class="c1"># Docker and other containers).</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># In order to make Redis Cluster working in such environments, a static</span>
<span class="c1"># configuration where each node known its public address is needed. The</span>
<span class="c1"># following two options are used for this scope, and are:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># * cluster-announce-ip</span>
<span class="c1"># * cluster-announce-port</span>
<span class="c1"># * cluster-announce-bus-port</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Each instruct the node about its address, client port, and cluster message</span>
<span class="c1"># bus port. The information is then published in the header of the bus packets</span>
<span class="c1"># so that other nodes will be able to correctly map the address of the node</span>
<span class="c1"># publishing the information.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># If the above options are not used, the normal Redis Cluster auto-detection</span>
<span class="c1"># will be used instead.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Note that when remapped, the bus port may not be at the fixed offset of</span>
<span class="c1"># clients port + 10000, so you can specify any port and bus-port depending</span>
<span class="c1"># on how they get remapped. If the bus-port is not set, a fixed offset of</span>
<span class="c1"># 10000 will be used as usually.</span>

<span class="c1">################################## SLOW LOG ###################################</span>

<span class="c1"># The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified</span>

<span class="c1"># like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,</span>
<span class="c1"># but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only</span>
<span class="c1"># stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve</span>
<span class="c1"># other requests in the meantime).</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis</span>
<span class="c1"># what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the</span>
<span class="c1"># command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the</span>
<span class="c1"># slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the</span>
<span class="c1"># queue of logged commands.</span>

<span class="c1"># The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent</span>
<span class="c1"># to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while</span>

<span class="c1"># Redis can notify Pub/Sub clients about events happening in the key space.</span>
<span class="c1"># This feature is documented at http://redis.io/topics/notifications</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># For instance if keyspace events notification is enabled, and a client</span>
<span class="c1"># performs a DEL operation on key &quot;foo&quot; stored in the Database 0, two</span>
<span class="c1"># messages will be published via Pub/Sub:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># PUBLISH __keyspace@0__:foo del</span>
<span class="c1"># PUBLISH __keyevent@0__:del foo</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># It is possible to select the events that Redis will notify among a set</span>
<span class="c1"># of classes. Every class is identified by a single character:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#  K     Keyspace events, published with __keyspace@&lt;db&gt;__ prefix.</span>
<span class="c1">#  E     Keyevent events, published with __keyevent@&lt;db&gt;__ prefix.</span>
<span class="c1">#  g     Generic commands (non-type specific) like DEL, EXPIRE, RENAME, ...</span>
<span class="c1">#  $     String commands</span>
<span class="c1">#  l     List commands</span>

<span class="c1">#  e     Evicted events (events generated when a key is evicted for maxmemory)</span>
<span class="c1">#  A     Alias for g$lshzxe, so that the &quot;AKE&quot; string means all the events.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#  The &quot;notify-keyspace-events&quot; takes as argument a string that is composed</span>
<span class="c1">#  of zero or multiple characters. The empty string means that notifications</span>
<span class="c1">#  are disabled.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#  Example: to enable list and generic events, from the point of view of the</span>
<span class="c1">#           event name, use:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#  notify-keyspace-events Elg</span>

<span class="c1">#  Example 2: to get the stream of the expired keys subscribing to channel</span>

<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#  notify-keyspace-events Ex</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#  By default all notifications are disabled because most users don&#39;t need</span>

<span class="na">hash-max-ziplist-entries 512</span>
<span class="na">hash-max-ziplist-value 64</span>

<span class="c1"># Lists are also encoded in a special way to save a lot of space.</span>
<span class="c1"># The number of entries allowed per internal list node can be specified</span>
<span class="c1"># as a fixed maximum size or a maximum number of elements.</span>
<span class="c1"># For a fixed maximum size, use -5 through -1, meaning:</span>

<span class="c1"># -4: max size: 32 Kb  &lt;-- not recommended</span>
<span class="c1"># -3: max size: 16 Kb  &lt;-- probably not recommended</span>
<span class="c1"># -2: max size: 8 Kb   &lt;-- good</span>
<span class="c1"># -1: max size: 4 Kb   &lt;-- good</span>
<span class="c1"># Positive numbers mean store up to _exactly_ that number of elements</span>

<span class="c1"># performs a lazy rehashing: the more operation you run into a hash table</span>
<span class="c1"># that is rehashing, the more rehashing &quot;steps&quot; are performed, so if the</span>

<span class="c1"># The limit can be set differently for the three different classes of clients:</span>

<span class="c1"># slave  -&gt; slave clients</span>
<span class="c1"># pubsub -&gt; clients subscribed to at least one pubsub channel or pattern</span>

<span class="c1"># the limit for 10 seconds.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># By default normal clients are not limited because they don&#39;t receive data</span>
<span class="c1"># without asking (in a push way), but just after a request, so only</span>
<span class="c1"># asynchronous clients may create a scenario where data is requested faster</span>

<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The LFU counter is just 8 bits per key, it&#39;s maximum value is 255, so Redis</span>

<span class="c1">########################### ACTIVE DEFRAGMENTATION #######################</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># WARNING THIS FEATURE IS EXPERIMENTAL. However it was stress tested</span>
<span class="c1"># even in production and manually tested by multiple engineers for some</span>
<span class="c1"># time.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># What is active defragmentation?</span>
<span class="c1"># -------------------------------</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Active (online) defragmentation allows a Redis server to compact the</span>
<span class="c1"># spaces left between small allocations and deallocations of data in memory,</span>
<span class="c1"># thus allowing to reclaim back memory.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Fragmentation is a natural process that happens with every allocator (but</span>
<span class="c1"># less so with Jemalloc, fortunately) and certain workloads. Normally a server</span>
<span class="c1"># restart is needed in order to lower the fragmentation, or at least to flush</span>
<span class="c1"># away all the data and create it again. However thanks to this feature</span>
<span class="c1"># implemented by Oran Agra for Redis 4.0 this process can happen at runtime</span>
<span class="c1"># in an &quot;hot&quot; way, while the server is running.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Basically when the fragmentation is over a certain level (see the</span>
<span class="c1"># configuration options below) Redis will start to create new copies of the</span>
<span class="c1"># values in contiguous memory regions by exploiting certain specific Jemalloc</span>
<span class="c1"># features (in order to understand if an allocation is causing fragmentation</span>
<span class="c1"># and to allocate it in a better place), and at the same time, will release the</span>
<span class="c1"># old copies of the data. This process, repeated incrementally for all the keys</span>
<span class="c1"># will cause the fragmentation to drop back to normal values.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Important things to understand:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 1. This feature is disabled by default, and only works if you compiled Redis</span>
<span class="c1">#    to use the copy of Jemalloc we ship with the source code of Redis.</span>
<span class="c1">#    This is the default with Linux builds.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 2. You never need to enable this feature if you don&#39;t have fragmentation</span>
<span class="c1">#    issues.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 3. Once you experience fragmentation, you can enable this feature when</span>
<span class="c1">#    needed with the command &quot;CONFIG SET activedefrag yes&quot;.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The configuration parameters are able to fine tune the behavior of the</span>
<span class="c1"># defragmentation process. If you are not sure about what they mean it is</span>
<span class="c1"># a good idea to leave the defaults untouched.</span>

<span class="c1"># Enabled active defragmentation</span>
<span class="c1"># activedefrag yes</span>

<span class="c1"># Minimum amount of fragmentation waste to start active defrag</span>
<span class="c1"># active-defrag-ignore-bytes 100mb</span>

<span class="c1"># Minimum percentage of fragmentation to start active defrag</span>
<span class="c1"># active-defrag-threshold-lower 10</span>

<span class="c1"># Maximum percentage of fragmentation at which we use maximum effort</span>
<span class="c1"># active-defrag-threshold-upper 100</span>

<span class="c1"># Minimal effort for defrag in CPU percentage</span>
<span class="c1"># active-defrag-cycle-min 25</span>
